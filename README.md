# Final-Project-Tableau

## Introduction
The goal was to assist real estate investors in making informed decisions when selecting rental properties in New York City. An AirBnB dataset spanning from 2008 to 2015, containing rental price information for various property types across five NYC districts, was selected. To enhance the analysis, an additional dataset containing NYC zip code-district data and average property prices for housing was incorporated for added insights.


## Project/Goals

### Goal (task oriented)
Assess the feasibility and potential profitability of investing in real estate properties in neighborhoods of NYC.

### Goal (study oriented)
Show basic knowledge in Tableau by presenting different data visualizations  related to given the task.

## Process Steps

### 1. Select Option and Dataset,
### 2. Deside the question I want to answer,
### 3. Observe the data,decided to add more data from other web sources to help answering the main question
### 4. Create visualizations for EDA, highlighing main property types and districts, finding trends and outliers,
### 5. Getting to conclusion, answering the main question,
### 6. Creating Dashboard consisting of all visualization created,
### 7. Creating Story,
### 8. Uploading data on Tableau Public and on my GitHub repository (https://github.com/GaryManv/Tableau-Project-2),
### 9. Creating a presentation using visuals from Tableau uploading on my GitHub repository,
### 10. Filling out README.md file

## Methods & Results

I chose Option 2 with AirBnB dataset. 

The main question was "“Where to invest in Real Estate in New York City?”

The following visualisations were created:
1. Map : showing AirBnB hosts on the map. Help to visually detect outliers, district out of NYC,
2. Map : with filtered data. To present area which would be analysed,
3. Treemap : to show proportion (%) of Number of Hosts per Neighbourhood,
4. Packed bubbles: to show proportion (%) of Property Types per Neighbourhood,
5. Box-and-whiskers: Checking Price Outliers (over the medium price range).To understand which aggregation to use (mean or median).
6. Line chart with trend line: Checking Trend for Rent Prices from 2008 to 2015. Will our investment be feasable over the years?
7. Side-by-side bar chart: ROI per Property Types per Neighbourhood.  Which district and property type is the most attractive in terms of buying new property for rent?
8. Line chart with trend line: Checking AirBNB customers review rates by neighbourhood. What's the trend of reviews, especially for the district we choose?

## Challenges 

Difficulty when realised that provided dataset couldn't answer my question!!!
Time-consuming due to Tableau inexperience.
Non-expertise in real estate data analysis

## Future Goals
Do more replications of visualizations done by Tableau experts
